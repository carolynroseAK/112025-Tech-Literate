                        <h2>Cyber Security Tips</h2>
                        <p>Stay safe, secure, and confident as you navigate this new landscape—your digital life matters.
                            <p>🔐 1. Be skeptical of unexpected messages</p>
                            <p>Don’t click on links or open attachments from unfamiliar senders.
                            Even if a message looks like it’s from a friend or company, double-check—scammers often impersonate trusted sources.</p>
                        <p>📞 2. Never share personal info over phone or email.</p>
                        <p>Legitimate companies won’t ask for your Social Security number, bank info, or passwords out of the blue.
                            If in doubt, hang up or delete the message and contact the company directly.</p>                            
                            <p>🧠 3. Pause before acting on urgency</p> 
                            <p>Scammers use panic to pressure you.
                            If someone says “act now” or “don’t tell anyone,” stop and talk to someone you trust.</p>
                            <p>🧓 4. Learn the common scams</p>
                            <p>Watch out for the following: 
                            “Sweetheart” scams (fake online romances).Tech support scams (fake pop-ups or calls).
                            Fake government benefits or debt relief offers. Impersonation of customer service reps.</p>
